# Thursday March 10th 1864.
Quite a change of weather. It has been raining all day at a pretty good rate.
I like to see it as we need rain very much. The 7t W. Va., Cav. went to Wheeling to day 3/4 of them having re-enlisted as Veterans. They only left about 100 back. They did well in the Veteran business. Re- enlisting is progressing rapidly again. From some cause It was slack for a few days but it has burst out again with a good prospect of getting nearly all our boys. It is a good thing. Had some beautiful music last night from a brass band in the street which caused me to have pleasant dreams. Au revoir.


# March 11th.
A Scouting party came in today. They captured a wedding party 8 miles above Winchester bringing in the groom & all the party. The groom is a First Lieut. on Gen. R. E. Lee's Staff. It has been raining all day and is very disagreeable.

## March 12th.
This has been a very fine day. Quite different from yesterday. Well news are scarce and far between. Some of our Veteran boys are carrying on a little but who has a better right the opinion of copperheads notwithstanding. We will receive horses to equip our command in a day or two and then I suppose we may look for a raid. We are ready for it.

# March 13th. *5*
Pleasant day but most too windy for promenading. All quiet. Somebody raised a scare last night and had the boys out for fight but no one came. The Signal Corps kept up a terrible signalling pretty near all night. Had some splendid music from a brass band last night. It was delightful.

# March 14th.
It is reported that small parties of rebels in our uniform are prowling about and the guards have been increased to day and everything prepared to catch them if possible. Heavy scouts are being sent out to catch the "cusses" and make a public example of them. They should be treated as spies if caught in our uniform.

# March 15th.
This has been a cool blusterey day. Several large scouting parties were sent out to day and every one is on the "qui vive" for rebels. It is said that they are advancing down the valley on us but it is to be hoped
that it is untrue as we are not ready for rebels yet. Sigel paid us a flying visit on yesterday. Preparing for action if necessary in our command.

# March 16th.
All is quiet, The town looks deserted to day. Col. Wells Comdr. of Post here has posted guards all around so that no one can get in or out of town without a pass. It is a good idea. Hear no more from the rebels & suppose that they have "dried up." Cold as Greenland & windy.

# March 17th. 7
This has been a fine day. To day Gen. Averell forms a Div. of Cavy. composed of 9 regiments and 4 Battalions, besides an artillery & Infantry. His Div. is becoming a big thing and I suppose our next move will be a raid. All is quiet in our vicinity the rebels having become quiet. No one is sorry I guess for their sudden "drying up" at least. I am not for my part.

# March 18.
All quiet except the wind which is blowing a hurricane. Gen. Stahl has been here for what purpose I know not. It is said he will get a command here. We are extending our lines a little since we have become a big Command. I fear we will get a little vain of ourselves.

# March 1864
Very nice day. The 5th W. Va. Cav. left here to day and have gone to Cumberland. They will leave this Division I believe. A Scout went out to day. Three more Cav. Regts. are to be added to our Div. and we will have a big one then. There are no rebels in this part of the country now I believe.

I hope I will have to follow my regiment soon as I am getting discouraged where I have to jump at the bidding of a Master.

# Mar. 20.
Very cold to day and to night it is freezing very much. Nothing new to day. Last night our Genl. came pretty near dying. He is better to day. Have been out in the country to day and find everything right. Beautiful country in this part of the valley of Va.

# March 21. 9
A very nice but cool day. A Frenchman a few days ago enlisted in the 6th. W. Va. Cavy. saying that he had been von tarn rebel long enough & now would be "von union man." He asked for leave to go out into the country to settle up his business before he went a sojering. This mild request was granted and "froggy" went out. At the expiration of his leave he came back. Was asked if he had got his business settled. Said he, "Yes me make von grand tragedy." Came to find out his meaning and he had killed his wife by chopping her all to pieces. This is true to the word. He thought by becoming a soldier he would escape the penalties of the law. He is in jail heavily ironed. Everything is quiet. We are getting horses for our command slow but sure.
10

# March 22.
A fine day but very cold. Nothing new on the stage. More tragedies. A man marries a woman goes off soldiering, wife hears he is dead again. 1st husband comes back and who shall have the woman? Quite a romantic affair but havent time to write it.

# March 23.
All is right to day. It is a little cool but otherwise a very pleasant day. We hear of no enemy now-a-days and it surprises me a little as it is time they should be waking us up. The 6 W.Va. Cavy. is detached from the Cavy. Div and Capt. Truxal has sent a letter requesting the Gen. us of whom I am one, to our regts. Not much notice is taken of it. Feel lonely, but hark the music.

# March 24th. 11
This in a beautiful day. So very pleasant and nice. Nothing new to day. Military movements very slow indeed. Adieu.

# March 25th
A queer day, It has been raining & snowing to day and this evening there is quite a snow on the ground Nothing new to day. All is quiet. No signs of a move and we are, or I at least, getting the blues.

# March 26th.
A tolerable fine day 'tho' rather soft under foot. There is nothing new to day, I believe. Small parties of rebels still hover around us picking up horses wherever they can find them. It is very quiet here for the time of year. Every person thought we would have been fighting ere this. But so it goes & weare not sorry.
12

# March 27th.
This is a lovely day, how I wish I could be in dear old Penns. among the hospitable people. But tonight we had quite a time in church. The cry of fire! was given
and almost everybody rushed for the door which raised quite an excitement for a few minutes. It was nothing. All quiet in front. Too quiet to keep away the blues.

# March 28th.
A beautiful day. The 34th Mass. Inf. with its really splendid band have been parading around town to day. It was a grand and beautiful affair. It is the nicest thing we have had here for some time. To day we got orders that all men detached from the 5th W. Va. Cavy. return to their Regt. & so I leave tomorrow. It is all right and I am not sorry.

# March 29.
Left Martinsburg and came to Cumberland, shook hands & chatted with Col. Latham and am at present quietly esconsed in the Barnum house.
It has been raining & snowing like station to day, and it is a very disagreeable day. Bad weather to go into camp.

# March 30. All right, Weather fairer but is very disagreeable. Slides in the mountains stopped the Trains. # March 31. Beautiful day.
Made a flying trip up to my Regt. at Patterson Creek, 10 miles, and return to day. Had a very good time. Stevens & I were detailed as clerks at Dept. Hd Qrs to day. We are bound to fight mit Sigel now.
14

# "All fools day" 1864.
Bad weather, extremely so. Have not been put to work yet and I feel as if I would die with ennui. I wish they would put us at something to while away the time.

This is a "Bully" place, Heard a speech last night that pleased me considerably. It was in favor of emancipation in this state and was the most cutting thing on slaveholders I have heard for many a day April 2d. Wet ugly day. Too bad to look out of doors. Ex. Gov. Thomas made a speech in the Belvidere Hall last night. It was quite interesting to Union folks. Nothing is stirring but soldiers. My diary will be necessarily short for want of news.

# April 3d. Went to church this evening and it reminded me much of old times.
This is a tolerable fine day. Troops are constantly passing through here on their way to Y. W. Va. where a rebel
raid is expected I believe.

# April 4. Snowing all day and it is very disagreeable. Commenced to work to day & like it pretty well in my new place. There are a hard set of boys about Hd. Qrs.

# April 5. Snowing again to day like fun, Troops are still passing thro' Westward and I suppose something is about to turn up out in that direction. I guess a flare, Up' is expected at or near Beverly & the troops are going there.
15

# April 6th
A very nice day. Nothing is stirring except the troops.
They are being hurried to Beverly for some purpose or other.
We may expect at any moment big work in this Department as the rebels are becoming aroused to & sense of their duty and I will not be surprised if they try to do some big work.

# April 7th. This has been a lovely day. From all appearances we will have some very nice weather. The 280 Pa. Cav. went some place to day, and a big Regt. it is, the largest I have seen for a long time. They look as if they would be able to waken up rebels. We hear of no movements in this part of the world.

# April 8th. 17
This has been one of April's smiling days. A lovelier day I have not seen for some time. Everything quiet to day.
Not even a drunken soldier is to be seen a fact not to be regretted. Our officers
still keep circulating around in fancy dress &c.
I wouldn't mind wearing some of their clothes but would dislike much to have their characters.
The streets are being cleaned up to day, a fact not to be hooted at. This fine weather causes me to be in excellent spirits - feel as if I could do almost anything. The close proximity of the 10" of July pleases me not a little.
18

# April 9th.
A day of rain & sunshine with a salute of 13 guns in honor of the arrival at this
place of H. Hamlin Vice President of the U. S.
The old follow made his appearance to day and I got a peep at him, which is something I have not seen before. We boys have taken a mania for apple and nick-nax eating
to day and we have made the good things fly around in a wonderful manner. We must have our sprees, and as we are not extra drinkers of the "stuff" we must eat some- thing. It is "all in the cool as the boys tell me. All quit on the potomac.

# April 10th. 19
A beautiful day with an occasional sprinkling of the rain. The river (Potomac)
is is booming high to day & it is making things fairly whistle.
The Ringgold Battalion came here to day to join their Regiment the 22d Pa. Cavy. A lot of Generals are circulating around here to day as if they were Lords of the soil which I wouldnt be surprised is the fact about here.
The bells are ringing merrily to day for church and I would like to go but guess
I shant. All is quiet here. I hear that Gen. Averell has had a little mass
at Winchester.
20

# April 11th.
A beautiful day. Spring is coming out smiling lovely. Hope we may have any
amount of this kind of weather as it suits me. Quite a shocking affair occured
here to day. Some hard words passed between two soldiers when one shot the other dead on the spot. A terrible morning.
A skirmish between a few of our men and some rebels came off at Capon to day and one of our boys shot he died this evening. The Rebels were driven off.
they intended capturing our train I believe, (Express train.) That was a little affair in which they were second best.

# April 12th. 
This is another lovely day, everything blooming. The 20" Pa. Cavy. passed thro' town to day with their music, which was not as good an it might be. They camp here to get equipped. At last the 9" Va. Cavy. goes to the Kanawha Valley and General Averell loses another of his best Regiments. He loses them one by one and directly he will have a small Division again.
Everything quiet to day I believe. It is said that one of our scouts - Charley Trissler - was captured this morning only about five miles from here. That in quite a queer affair -so very close too.
22

# April 13th.
Fine day etc. The 5" W. Va. Cavy. passed through here to night on its way to the Kanawha Valley. So they go and a gay time they have running about. Another soldier was shot to day. The plagued fool was trying to run away from an armed guard & the consequence was he got shot thro' the foot, which caused him to halt very sudden. The 1st Va. Vat. Cav. and some of the 14" Pa. Cav. also pissed thro' here to night. Two more Regts. less at Martinsburg. The rebels are fools if they dont take that place now. It is easily done.

# April 14th 23
A dreary, weary, lonely day. Nothing now on the tapis to day. No new movements of troops can be recorded. I hope that something may turn up to make affairs a little more lively. It is a wonder to me, at least, that movements of some kind
are not being made. It is rather an inactive spring, more than we wish for.
The town still keeps swarmed with officers who strut around town as if they were "lords of the soil."
Well must "dry up" and go to the Theatre. 11 Oclock. Just in from Theatre and had a very good time. Pretty near laughed myself to death. Shall go again I think.
24

 April 15th.
All quiet and very nice day. Nothing new to day. Plenty of fun these nights. The Theatre is progressing finely and the fun is contagious. Hear that our troops have been massacred in Fort Pillow by the Rebel Gen. Forrest. I dont know whether it in true or not but if so it is a horrible affair.

# April 16th. 
Another tolerable fine day, but indications of rain. Nothing exciting now-a-days to pass away the time. Some little fixes happened down the Rail R. a few days ago and it seems that we cant have peace let who will command the Dept. Perhaps we will have quiet here one of these days. But let "her rip" we ain't caring.

# April 17th. 25
Another very pretty day &c. & &c. Everything looks lively today. Bells ringing, people going to church all looks very nice but I cant see it.

# April 18th.
Gen. Averell, Staff and the rest of the necessary evils with him, passed thro' here to day on their way to Grafton W. Va. If I am informed right their true purpose is to go on a raid. Capt. Ramsey Averell's A. A. G. got himself into a scrape while here. He was going to shoot a guard and called him some pretty hard names. He was ordered under arrest and I hope they will put him thro'. He is a very mean principled man at any rate. Averell's troops have pretty near all gone through. This is a pretty day. Everything is quiet is this part of the country. Cant hear of anything that will instruct or amuse.

# April 19th. 27
Very pretty day &c. Nothing now to day. Another of Genl. Averell's Regiment went through here to night.

# April 20th.
Everything is lovely at present. Nothing new worth recording, and we go to

# April 21st.
and find affairs all quiet with nothing at all to mar the quiet of garrison life in its bluest form. As I cant find anything to write I must "dry up."

# April 22d.
Pretty day. A Brigade of troops passed here for Martinsburg today and one Regt. and 2 Batteries left here for Williamsport. I think that the Genl. will get his troops in position soon, at least, it is to be hoped so.
28

# April 23d.
It has been very warm to day. It makes a fellow sweat like fun.
Some troops passed through, Eastward bound to day. Nothing new (I see by the papers that our forces on or about the Red river have gained a victory over the Rebs'. I hope it is true.

# April 25th. To day is as lovely as a rat in a hay mow and twice as gentle.
Nothing new to day to cause excitement. The 54" Pa. Vols. left here to day for Martinsburg which caused some regret in the city, as the boys were well liked and were a fine set of boys. Hope they will have good luck wherever they may go.

# April 25th. 29
Rained very hard last night and to day it is very comfortable. All quiet. A
Maryland soldier was brought home dead to day, having died by being starved at Richmond. It is a horrible affair and should be checked in some manner.
I dont believe in having our noble boys starved by the infernal causes in the South. April 26th. Another beautiful day. Comfortable and nice. Troops have been passing thro' here to day as usual and if this Dept. is not getting mixed up I
dont guess right. But Sigel will put things all right before he is done. We
hear bad news of the surrender at Plymouth today.
30

# April 27th.
The Cavalry Brigade that has been stationed here for some time, left to day for Martinsburg. Gen. Sigel and part of Staff have also gone there and we, I believe go there, that is, Dept. Head Quarters move up there. This is an affair that doesn't suit us as well as it might. All the troops in this part of the country
are concentrating at Martinsburg to form the 1st Infantry and 1st Cavalry Division of this Department. Gen. Sullivan Comdg. the former and Gen. Stahel both.
The Department will be organized at last and then we will have affairs in good style once more. I hope it will soon come to pass and then we'll know where we are.

# April 28th. 31
All right in Cumberland and the weather so lovely that it just pleases me.
Troops still going & coming and from present indications we will soon be ready for the field. That would suit me. We are packing up everything ready to go to Martinsburg. All quiet &c.

# April 29th. 
Beautiful day &c. Left dear old Cumberland to day at 10 Oclock,
arrived at Martinsburg at 2 PM. a distance of 89 miles.
We had a pleasant ride & enjoyed myself hugely. There is some lovely scenery along the route which has a charm for me that I can not find in the city.
32
The General has moved on out to Winchester & I presume that we will do likewise.
I was welcomed home at my former boarding house by widow Ringer and daughter. They are fine people and my friends. The troops have all moved out to Winchester and we have a large force there. A fight will be the next thing on the roll.

# April 30. 
Left Martinsburg to day and seven of us were put in a wagon (spring)
& a happy ride we had to Bunker Hill. 11 miles where we are at present encamped preparing for moving.
It rained to day and made the trip a little unpleasant. 33
All nature seems alive, the green fields, trees in bloom and the little birds warbling their sweet notes all make me glad that we are to live in the country a while.
The troops are concentrating here, about 12000 men in all. We are putting up at the game spot we did last summer when Averell stopped here.

# May 1st. 
Left Bunker Hill to day and marched one mile outside of Winchester on the Stanton pike and camped on a beautiful farm. Had some girls in Winchester to turn up their noses at me, but I couldn't see the compliment. Some of the Citizens waved their 'kerchiefs at us and seemed
34
pleased to see us.
We had a pleasant march thro' the most beautiful country in Virginia.

# May 2d. 
Lay in camp to day. It is very cold these nights, it is almost impossible to sleep. I wish that summer would come. The General received and inspected his troops to day. It was a fine sight. The boys are in splendid order for fight and in good spirits. If they get a chance to try the Rebels on I think they
will not be found wanting. We had a train captured from us near Bunker Hill to day. There were 7 empty wagons. The cusses will harass us as much as possible now.
35

# May 3d.
Very cool to day with a little rain. It is quite different from living In a
comfortable house in the City. All quiet at present I believe. We packed up and
sent back to Martinsburg, everything that was not really necessary, to day.
It looks as if we were going on a "bust" out in the country.
We will have a good time I think. I would dislike very much to go out and get
whipped. The bands in camp are playing merrily to day. I love to hear the music rough as it is.
-13--

# May 4th.
Lovely day. One of our scouts captured one of Ewell's scouts to day and a fine looking fellow he is too. There is nothing new to day.
36
of interest. Genl. Sigel reviewed and drilled his artillery and Infantry to day. He puts them thro' while he is at it. A terrible noise is kept going by the bands all the while. Everybody preparing for a move which I hope will come off one of these days soon. # May 5th. To night the 34" Mass. band serenaded Genls. Sigel & Stahel and the way they made the brandy fly is a caution to cold water men. They make splended music & deserve their brandy. We have received intelligence that 25 rebels entered the camp of the 6" Va. Cavy. last night at Martinsburg and carried off a few horses. It was abold trick. This is lovely weather and just right for movements. 37

# May 6th. 
Another lovely and hot day. It has been a roaster. Nothing new except
that we hear that Piedmont W. Va. was captured by 100 rebels under Capt. McNeill and sacked, train captured and mail and prisoners robbed. They are going in on
the muscle. All is quiet at Winchester, so says the N. Y. Herald.

# May 7th. 
Hot as the burning desert and twice as ugly. No news to day, but I
think we will have some before many days pass over our heads. On to Richmond will be our cry before long and then for a family trip up the Valley which will
be good fun.
38

# May 8th.
Another hot day, plague it, it pretty near roasts me.
No news yet to day. We are preparing for a move thank fortune. Want to get out of this place as soon as possible.
Occasionally a rebel is brought in which is the only variety we have in this hot climate.

# May 9th. 
Broke up camp to day and started up the valley.
Passed thro' Kernstown, Burlington and Newtown, stopping on the outskirts of Newtown to rest. At this place water was set out for the soldiers, from which it might be inferred that they are not rabid secessionists.
"Porte Crayon" is riding with us taking sketches &c. and I hope will sketch and
Publish for the amusement and interest of his admirers, this trip. This is a beautiful country,
this is my first trip in this part of the valley. Marched on thro Middletown
1/2 miles beyond and about three miles from Strasburg where we are camping for the 39
night in a beautiful yard. Very hot to day. Saw about 1/2 dozen men give under
with Sun-stroke along the road.
It is 18 miles from Winchester to Strasburg.

# May 10. Very warm to day. Lay in camp all day, doing nothing but eating hard tack. One of Battery B. 5" U.S. Arty. was shot while bathing to day. The
murderer was caught. He should be hanged. 40

# May 11th 1864.
Marched to day within one mile of Woodstock camping for the night in a very fine yard. It is said that there are a few rebels in our front but we anticipate no
trouble from them. We have had very peaceful times so far.
We read of Gen. Grants success, and right glad are we to hear it. The valley is
as lovely as ever, looks the same as it did in 1862 when we marched up it.

# May 12th. 
All quiet to day. It has been raining at intervals all day. We lay
in camp for what purpose I suppose Gen. Sigel knows. We hear of no rebels anywhere near us and I think that we will not be molested much, very soon.

# May 13th. 41
It has been raining all day, but who cares if he is in a tent as all the troops
are here. A reconnaissance was made to day, but have not heard the result Of it. -15-
Some of our troops and and Capt. McNeil (rebel) with his company had a skirmish in our rear 7 miles this P. M. This evening a scout was sent out to see what is in the wind. Through
here is the Manassas Gap Rail Road over which Johnson's troops were run to defeat
Gen. Frank Patterson at the first Bull Run. This part of the valley will have
a prominent position in the history of this Rebellion. Fremont's march thro' here will never be forgotten by those who made it. I know almost every spot of interest in the Valley.
42

# May 14th.
Has been raining all day.
Our train was attacked about two miles S. of Winchester to day. No harm done.
Our mail guard was also attacked but got in with the mail. Some of the boys were wounded. Some more of our force went out to Mount Jackson this morning and this evening we can hear the cannon plainly from that place and I suppose that a small fight is in progress. The cannon shots sound as of old and does a person good
to hear the sound when he is 10 miles off.

# May 15th. 
How uncertain are my prophecies. Thought this morning that we could whip anything in the valley and would go right on to Staunton. But how different. Marched
43
to Mount Jackson through a steady continuous rain. Arriving there we heard heavy fighting about 6 miles in front. About one-third of our force was engaged at first but in a short time about three-fourths got into it, and there was some of the most desperate fighting that has been been done in the Valley Everything was progressing finely but the rebels being reinforced by Breckenridge with a heavy force the
tables soon turned. After about four hours fighting a retreat was ordered which was done in very good order. We lost five pieces of Artillery and a great many men. We retreated back about 8 miles which kept us busy all night as we made all kinds of movements.
The whole of the fighting was done in a drenching rain. It is said that the majority of our cavalry would not stand up to the work. If it be true it is rather disgraceful. Having no horse I got no nearer than three miles to the fight. The affair really lasted two days but the hard fighting was done during the second day. Our Infantry and Artillery fought well and our loss about 800 men. The rebels had about 5000 more men than we had. It is supposed that Breckenridge was on his way from Kentucky to reinforce Lee and pounced on and shipped us as a mere pastime. Their lose heavy.

# May 16th. 45
Marched back to our old camp ground at Cedar Creek, to day. By burning the bridge
at Mount Jackson we kept the enemy from harassing us any. We have made a splendid retreat.This has been a very nice day, good weather for Infantry to march and
easy on the wounded. We had to- leave all our dead and all but about 200 of our wounded back on the battle ground. Our army is in good spirits and condition,
ready to fight again if need be. We have a poor set of Cavalry it seems. The
citizens treated us well notwithstanding their side whipped. They have learned
better than to shoot at retreating soldiers.
46

# May 17th 1864.
This has been a very nice day. Have been lying in camp all day recruiting our wasted frames etc. Rebels didn't follow us, consequently we are in comparative
peace. There are no rebels near us that we are aware of.

# May 18th. 
All quiet with plenty of rain to make affairs agreeable. Our pontoon train came on today, which says very plainly we go up the valley again.
Genl. Sigel has issued a congratulatory order to his command and in it promises them another fight soon.
The Genl. was out about 10 miles to the front to day looking at the sights. Some bushwhacker will pick him off yet.

# May 19th. 47
All right to day. Nothing new. Received news from Gen. Crook of our Dept. in the Kanawha Valley which states that he whipped the rebels 3 times. That repays us for our reverse up at New Market. Good news from everywhere. I hope it will continue & the war end soon.

# May 20th. 
This has been a beautiful day - beyond comparison. Nothing of interest to day. The usual routine of work is all that can be recorded and it I dont like at all. Dont like to work, goes against the grain of a soldier to engage in any kind of work, even if it is mental labor. The troops are drilling and preparing themselves
for another fight and march if necessary.
48

# May 21st.
A lovely day. All quiet &c. This evening Maj. Gen. Hunter and Staff came here.
I presume for the purpose of relieving Gen. Sigel. It rather goes ahead of my time somewhat and I am at a loss to tell what it all means.
I suppose that it is all right, although I do not like the idea of losing Gen. Sigel. Perhaps he will not leave us, and if he does a good man takes his place. They are both good Genls. in my opinion and it is immaterial which commands, so long as he does things up right, a few days will tell us what it all means.

# May 22d. 49
Hot and ugly, generally, to day. Have been writing all day getting the Dept. under its new leader in a good rig. Gen. Sigel takes command of the Reserve Div. in
this Dept. He has been very sick to day and looks very bad indeed. We are pre- paring for a move again and I suppose will cause some one to bite the dust again. Gen. Hunter is commencing very vigorously and I hope he may have good success. The troops are very much dissatisfied at losing Gen. Sigel. Genl. Hunter has reduced our train until it has got to be a small thing which is a good beginning.
We are to subsist off the country and all that sort of thing. God grant us success. Hope we may retrieve our defeat at New Market.
50

# May 23d.
All quiet in the valley.
Having been writing all day again a I feel slightly tired with my labor. We will
have affairs in rig soon and then we will have easier times.
We are ordered to supply ourselves with ten days rations to be carried and I suppose we will make a 10 days expedition. We get 4 lbs. of bread for our 10 days. We will have a hungry trip I fear. Some of our pickets were surprised and captured
on the night of the 21st., 18 men. Gen. Hunter is trimming up this force and he
will have a good command before he is thro' with it. Every one seems to be busy preparing for the coming campaign.

# May 24. 51
Busy as you please. All quiet. The order is to live off the country and
Slaughter and eat horses & mules if necessary. Thats Bully. We are not caring
how affairs turn up so we are victorious &c. Gen. Hunter is squaring up things
as he goes. I predict again, that we are this time victorious.
The Genl. is dismissing all officers who are in the least lax in their duty. Two
scouts sent to the A. P. have returned. They were captured three times by the Rebels and had a hard time generally. They were a hard looking set when they came in. The western part of our Dept under Crook & Averell are doing a big work.
I am patiently for a horse to make a bold expedition on. We are all promised horses in a few days which put us in excellent spirits.

# May 25.
All quiet. Nothing to excite. A Little wet this evening.
Busy all day, haven't had time to move scarcely.

# May 26. Marched within 2 miles of Woodstock to day. Fine day for marching.
A house was burned down near Strasburg to day, it is said because the guerrillas -19--
fired on our troops, from it. The order from Gen. Hunter is to burn down every house from which a guerrila fires. He is going to put an end to this bushwhacking I hope. Nothing new along the road. A great many dead horses are lying stretched along it. Caught one rebel on the march, I believe. All is quiet in and about Woodstock & vicinity.

# May 27. 53
All gay to day. The bands have been serenading the Gen. to day. One band was
playing "Just in time for Lanigans ball" and the old fellow skipped around over the porch to it and it was real amusing. We are living partly, off the country now. 

# May 28. 
Fine day. Got me a horse to day. He is a regular Pegassus. He is
about as long as one of Abe's rails and as intricate as one of his proclamations.
I'll have a gay time chasing down thro' this valley.
Confiscation is going on heavy to day. We are in the land of rebels and we eatables go. Wont starve as long as there is anything in the plagued country. All right and off tomorrow,

# May 29.
Fine day. Marched three miles beyond Mt. Jackson to day and found everything all
right. Chased some Rebels before us but no one hurt. Commenced subsisting off
the country this morning. The boys are living highly, too.

# May 30 
Fine day. Yesterday a train of ours was captured at or near Newtown,
also the guard. The boys are getting along finely in subsisting off this country
and we will devastate it before we leave it. It is said that Newtown will be
burned as a warning that no bushwhacking is allowed. Our dead from the late battle have only been half buried and we had them to bury over again. It is a horrible affair, surely.
Every house within five miles of where any of our forces are fired upon are to 55
be burned. That is the plan to take to get rid of the cusses.
-20-
From all accounts and what can be seen on the battle field, it is conceded by all that Gen. Sigel had no cause whatever, for getting whipped. All that hurt him was, that he couldn't handle his troops. I used to think Sigel a good Genl. but
I think diffrent now. From rebel papers we find that their lose here was fully 100 more than ours, but still we got whipped.
Our Gov't. rations have run out entirely, but the troops are living off the fat of
the land. The whole command is eager to try the Rebels under Gen. Hunter. I
think more of the Gen. every day. I have always observed the difference between American & foreign officers & it can be seen favorably for American, as it always is, between Genl. Hunter & Sigel.
56

# May 31st.
Lay in camp all day and it has been very warm. What we are lying here bewilders the wisest. Perhaps it is all for the best, but as far as I am concerned, I would
like to go ahead. The Genl. is continually out riding, taking a view, and studying
the country. Our communication was entirely out off with everyone on the 29" inst.
and we are now like Gen. Grant when he started for Vicksburg. We all hope for success which is the best we can do.

# June 1st. 
Still in camp. Our scouting parties occasionally bring in some rebels. We are reduced to half rations to day. 1/2 bl. of flour, do. of meat, a very little of coffee, sugar & salt make up our daily food. We had a Sergt. & 12 men capt'd on picket yesterday. Gen'ls. Crook & Averell are to meet us at Stanton. We will have enough force to hold our own then. We are in for it.

# June 2d. 59
Marched to Harrisonburg to day thro' dust and rain which rendered marching very uncomfortable. We came across our wounded here, who are in fine spirits and almost shouted with joy to see us. They have been treated well. Our advance had a
skirmish with Imboden causing him to beat a hasty retreat. It is said we will have
-21-
a knock down tomorrow. The guerrillas fired on our train to day. No casualties. we are twenty five miles from Stanton.

# June 3d. 
Lay in camp. The principal business has been in confiscating tobacco etc. The Rebels are about 8 miles from us in front, and I suppose we will have a fight tomorrow. Everything is in good order for a Va. muss and we'll give Imbdenna trial
of abolition skill.
Have some rebel prisoners. News scarce and cant tell what is going on outside of our own little circle. All quiet etc. etc.
58 

# June 4.
Marched one mile beyond Port Republic on the road from that place to Stanton, distance, 13 mis. We passed over the old Cross Keys battle ground and it looks
as natural as if were at home. Had to pontoon the river. The move rather astonishes all of us, we expecting to go direct to Stanton.

# June 5. 
Marched 2 miles this morning when we were met by the enemy. A fierce Cavy. charge took place and our boys run them. In a short time the battle opened in earnest we drving for a while until at last victory seemed in their favor by
they getting behind breatworks they had built. The Genl. sent a Brig. of Inf. around on their right flank
and in short time they had them whipped we capturing 1000 prisoners. Their 59 loss in all was over 2000. Our is between 5 & 700. We stopped for the night
at Piedmont 8 miles from Port Republic.
I have never seen such a well conducted fight since I have been in the service. Several charges were made by the Cav. and Inf. Every time but once they were successful. The General led us around in some very hot places. Maj. Genl. Stahel was slightly. The rebel Brig. Genl. W. E. Jones Comdg this Dept. was killed and
fell into our hands. We have captured 50 officers. Several Colonels and Majors are taken. Their dead are frightfully mangled, some of them being torn all to pieces with shells and their flesh on fire caused from it

# June 6th.
Again took up the line of march and got into Staunton about two oclock amid the waving of flags and the playing of bands.
Some union sentiment was manifested and boquets were thrown to us. This is a fine place of it is said, 3000 inhabitants. We are the first yankees ever here and it is almost worth a fellows life to gain such a victory and follow it up as we have.
Gen Hunter is adored by his troops now. He showed the finest generalship that ever has been shown in this valley. We have captured 3 cannon 1700 stands of arms and 1100 prisoners. Our loss is from men theirs in killed and wounded. Averell & Crook are near us

# June 7th. 61
Have been paroling wounded rebel prisoners all day. Three of us paroled about 500. Our force left town to day and we three were left in it. While we were
paroling the rebels were in town and it was only by the merest chance that we were not captured. Capt. Bier ADC. and Andy Johnson, clerk and I were the three. I
dislike very much this business of paroling.
Two of our boys were captured while we were in town. Excepting this we have not been disturbed by rebels since we captured the city. We are having gay times.
We will be reinforced by from 10 to 15000 men tomorrow and then we will have a better time. We will make our mark in this country before we leave it.
62 

# June 8th 1864.
All quiet. Lay in camp to day. Generals Crook and Averell joined us with their Divisions to day, swelling our force to from 20000 to 25000 men. We will put things thro' now. We are tearing the R.R. in every direction and have it pretty well torn up. Rebels mute.
June 9th. All quiet. Our boys have been busy all day tearing up the railroad, blowing up tunnels & burning bridges.
-23-
We are cleaning up the Southern Confederacy as we go along. Private property is respected but public property all goes up. We'll do our share of damage to this bogus affair this campaign. The command is in good order and ready for the march tomorrow.

# June 10th. 63
Marched 18 miles S. W. course to day to Midway passing thro' Greenville 5 miles from Midway. An old lady was giving us some lectures &c. as we passed her house, Our command is marching in four parallel columns, each Div. a different road. It
is fine marching, only a little dusty. Find no union people along this route.
We have had no interruption yet.

# June 11th. 
March 18 miles S. by S. W. course to day, to Lexington Va. One mile from town the bridge was burnt over the river and we had a very severe skirmish
losing 4 men. At this place is the Va. Mil. Institute which we will burn.
Stonewall Jackson was buried here. We got all kinds of trophies in the academy. There are some cannon here used in the revolutionary war.
64 

# June 12th.
Lay in camp to day burning up public works &a. We burnt some fine buildings, among others the residence of Gov. Letcher. Stonewall Jackson's remains are in
the Cemetery at this place. I got an order to day to report to my Regt. in the rear
for the purpose of being mustered out of the service. There are some of the most extensive libraries here that I ever saw. I have procured some very good works.
The cadets who attended the Military Academy here lived in style.

# June 13th. 
Fine day. Genl. Duffie let Cavy. Div. who left us at Staunton
joined us to day, having torn up 5 miles of the R.R. between Lynchburg & Charlottes- ville, captured 70 prisoners, 700 horses and burnt 300 wagons he captured from the Rebels.
Genl. Crook with hie 2d Inf. Div. captured 5 pieces of Artillery and 5 canal 65
boats to day. Our boys are doing the work up for them.
-24-
We have destroyed all public property that we can get at. The troops are in excellent condition and anxious to finish the grand work they have commenced. The enemy have got into our rear already and we can't send the train wagons back now, as was intended Averell's 2d Cav. Div has advanced 15 miles on the Buckhannon road. We are taking with us 4 pieces of Artillery trophies from the French; also a bronze statue of Washington.

# June 14". 
Marched thro a stifling dust to Buchanan 24 miles to day. Nothing new on the route. Passed within three miles of the Natural bridge but couldn't go to see it. I would have liked much to see it.
66
The rebels burnt the bridge across the James at this place which has caused us some inconvenience. The rebels have ceased bothering us and we are having peacable times.
Buchanan is a small place and of no account in a military point of view.

# June 15th. 
Marched S. by S. W. 17 miles to day, camping in the valley at the foot
of the Peaks of Otter and near the rail-road. We came over the Blue Ridge and a rougher road could not be imagined.
From the side of the mountain one of the most magnificent views is presented to sight that I ever saw. As far as the eye can reach a fine undulating country is
seen.
The Peaks of Otter is the finest sight for mountain scenery. One of the Peaks is
4260 ft. high and from the top a far more lovely view is
seen than from the side of the Mt. 67
June 16th. Very hot, dusty etc. Marched thro. Liberty and 5 miles on the road
toward Lynchburg, 8 miles for the days march. Our time has been occupied in tearing up the Va. and Tenn. R. R. which passes here. There has been some skirmishing in front to day and tomorrow I think there will be a heavy fight. We are only 20
-25-
miles from Lynchburg and it will be a big thing if we can capture the city. We
have rained the R. R. for theme

# June 17th. 
A wagon train going to the rear to day I saddled up my old Rozinante and am on my way back with them. I fear we may make a sorry trip of it as we only have 1 1/2 Regts. of Militia guarding it. We marched 17 miles to day, 175 to
go yet.
68
We are travelling over a new road to any of us. We are the first Yankees that have ever been seen in this part of the country.

# June 18th. 
Marched 2 miles beyond Fincastle on the Sweet Springs road today, coming 19 miles for the day. Came over Blue Ridge through Buford's Gap, a very rough & bad road. The people all along this route have never seen the Yanks before and some of them are very much frightened.

# June 19th. 
Marched 14 miles to day camping at Mrs. Scotto one mile from the base of Mountain. The four of us who were sent back from Genl. Hunter's
Had Qrs. with 3 others are acting as scouts.
69
We march about 3 miles in advance of the column, get all the good things to eat and make a few rebels skedaddle occasionally. We scared some citizens half to death to day. We are going very slow and I fear we may get into trouble yet. We all hope for the best though.

# June 20". 
arched 18 miles to Sweet Springs over two mountains to day. It was rough enough for any mountain climber. We have routed some Rebels on the way. The Red Sweet Springs is in sight of Camp. They are both beautiful but of not much note at present. We are seeing all the sights this trip that are to be seen in Va.
All quiet, the militia sound.

# June 21st.
Marched to White Sulphur Springs, 17 miles today. Came over the Alleghanies. Had a great deal of sport in front. It is somewhat dangerous to take the lead 5 & 6 miles, but we have fun.
Had a gay time getting our supper this evening. A lot of the Militia were going
to whip us out of it but they didn't try it. Our train was fired into this morning,
a few horses tumbled over, no one hurt. These 100 days Militia are a great set of lads. I have never seen soldiers yet who are inclined to pilfer as these thieves
are. Some of them ought to be shot for it an a warning to the others.
# June 22d. So ends the Raid.

# June 23d.
Came out of the Mts. this morning & started to White Sulphur, got part of the way and started up Anthony Creek after our train. Foolishly we marched in the open road and when we got to Alvon we were gobbled up. There are 13 of us together and as we were cut off in every direction we concluded to surrender.
We are in the hands of Gentlemen. What will be our fate is now to determine.

# June 24th. 
Were marched under guard to Calihan's Station, 16 miles to day. Our guards seem to fear that the Yankees will pounce on them.

# June 25th. 
Marched to Covington to day 5 miles where we are in jail. We got 1/4 lb. of bread in one day & I think it short eating. I guess we will have to go South.

Woman
When man has shut the door unkind On Pity, earth's divinest guest,
The wanderer never fails to find
A sweet abode in woman's breast,
By stranger hands their shallow graves were made; No stone memorial o'er their corpses laid;
In barren sands, and far away from home, they lie, No friend to shed a tear when passing by.

Loss of Gen Averell's command from May 1863 to 1864. Killed 5 officers & 60 man
Wounded 15 officers & 239 men
Missing 7 officers & 283 men
***
total 27 + 582 = 609
This includes all his losses for 1863, from the day he took command. He first commanded the 4th Sept. Brigade & next the 1st Sept. Brigade.
He has planned and made three raids causing the enemy at least 3 times his (Gen Averell's) loss and being successful in all but one - Rocky Gap - where he was overwhelmed by superior numbers and compelled to retire but not whipped.
